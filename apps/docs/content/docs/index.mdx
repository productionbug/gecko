### 3. Add HexpacketUIContainer

Add `HexpacketUIContainer` to your layout (required for Dialog, Drawer, ConfirmDialog, and Toast components):

```tsx
import { HexpacketUIContainer } from '@hexpacket/ui';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <HexpacketUIContainer />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 4. Start using components

```tsx
import { Button, Input, Label } from '@hexpacket/ui';

function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <div>
        <Label>Email</Label>
        <Input type="email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
